# STM32G474RET6-Nucleo

## This repository is an area where I upload the sample projects and related documents I created during the STM32 learning process.

[Blink Led Project](https://github.com/Acharx/STM32G474RET6-Nucleo/tree/main/01%20-%20STM32%20-%20Blink%20Led)

It is a project of blinking the LD2 LED on the Nucleo card at one-second intervals.
